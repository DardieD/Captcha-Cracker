	<br><h2><a id="Q1">How to crack a CAPTCHA</a></h2>
	To crack one/more captcha images present on the current PC, follow the steps detailed below:
	<ol>
		<li> Note down the complete path of the folder where the images reside</li>
		<li> Start the software</li>
		<li> Click on the "Get Cracking" tab</li>
		<li> Enter the path in the space provided</li>
		<li> Enter the number of images you want to crack</li>
		<li> From the list below, select the image that most resembles your captcha. If no such CAPTCHA exists, you may develop your own algorithm</li>
		<li> Click "Get Cracking" and wait for the software to process your images</li>
		<li> View the result </li>
	</ol>
	<br><h2><a id="Q2">Setting up the s/w</a></h2>
	The software installer will automatically save files in the appropriate folder. You do not need to 
	set up the software manually.

	<br><h2><a id="Q3">My CPT is not listed</a></h2>
	If your captcha is not listed and you have knowledge of python scripting, you can process and segment
	the images yourself and use our OCR engine to train, test and predict images. See the detailed documentation for more
	information.
	<br><h2><a id="Q4">Developer tools</a></h2>
	This section is meant for creating vector files, creating and training a newural network and testing 
	a family of captchas on the network. If you have a list of images of single characters representing your 
	training set, you can give the path of those images to the software. The images must be 
	placed in folders with the folder name equal to  the images (all As in folder A, etc). If your dataset contains both 
	capital and small letters, place the lowercase letters in a folder called "small". 
	To create and train your network, first click on "Create Vectors" and follow the instructions on screen.
	To train the network click on "Train" and follow the instructions on screen.
	Please note that training a neural network is a time consuming process. The speed at whic hthe network is trained 
	depends on the machine running the software.
