	<br><h2><a id="Q1">-What is a captcha</a></h2>
	A CAPTCHA  is a type of challenge-response test used in computing as an attempt to ensure that the 	response is generated by a human being. The process usually involves a computer asking a user to complete 		a simple test which the computer is able to grade. These tests are designed to be easy for a computer to 		generate but difficult for a computer to solve. If a correct solution is received, it can be presumed to have 		been entered by a human. A common type of CAPTCHA requires the user to type letters and/or digits from a 	distorted image that appears on the screen. Such tests are commonly used to prevent unwanted internet bots 	from accessing websites.
	
	<br><h2><a id="Q2">- Why is it important</a></h2>
	Captchas prevent unwanted internet bots from accessing websites and sending spam mails to users.
	       They differentiate between an human being and automated bot.
